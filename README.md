# Now we've generated our password but it's not too secure, as there's a pattern we need to shuffle it.

## Step 7 (Shuffling the password)
> Using shuffle(list) function from random module to shuffle the list

## Step 8 (Converting the list into the string)
> Using the join(list) function to convert the list into the string
